I have had the goal of learning how to build websites (learning the basics of html and css etc) for a while now. I feel like it is a good forray in to web development and what it means to be a software engineer. And if I haven't mentioned it to you already, I've been recently thinking about switching from my initial plan of Environmentl Engineering with a comp sci minor to a comp sci major with something else (maybe Child Study and Human development as a minor. I probably will make another blog post about my recent academic ponderings later. 

For now, the website. This came about through my wanting to build a website. And what better way to learn how to build a website than to start to build my own personal website from scratch. It is a multiobjective decision. 

a) I can learn webdevelopment skills and have a product to show of by the end.

b) Having a personal website is good in to long run to show case my portfolio and accomplishments.

c) I can use this blog as a journal to reflect on what I am doing and my current ponderings. I've always been bad and recording self
reflection and memories so this is a start to fix-that!

d) I also hope to fine tune my writing and one day write a journalistic piece about something I care about.
